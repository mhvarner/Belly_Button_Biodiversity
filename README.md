# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

### The Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge was a success after very long hours of work. For the challenge, it wanted me to update my index.html and plots.js files to include two more analysis visualizations: a bar chart and a bubble chart. I was able to create both with help from my previous module work syntax and through trial and error. I also had to keep going into the samples.json file in order to see if I was correctly using the right variables to point to the right data such as "samples", "otu_ids", "sample_values", and "otu_labels". Then I had to make sure I was calling the correct values from the top as I kept getting the "_____ is not defined" error. Eventually, the final page ended up looking great. I then went into my repository and made the files "master" in the page deployment section which I was then able to deploy the interactive webpage on the internet for everyone to see. 

### This challenge was extremely difficult. First, I had to figure out a way to correctly render the graphs from my javascript syntax and I was having issues with both of the graphs rendering. I then realized my error: On my index.html, I had the bubble chart first in the code and the bar chart second; but on my plots.js I had my bar chart first and my bubble chart second. I switched the order of the two charts and both ended up rendering, so I learned that you have to make sure both are in order on both files. What a relief that was!
